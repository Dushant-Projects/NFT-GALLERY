# NFT-GALLERY
NFT Gallery is a small React application that displays a collection of NFTs as cards. Each card shows the **name**, **artist**, **price**, and an **image**. You can filter NFTs by artist, click a card for details, and use the built-in voice assistant to read project information, list NFT names, and recall image file names.
